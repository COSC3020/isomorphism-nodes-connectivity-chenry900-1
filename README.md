# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ have the same number of nodes and are
completely connected, they must be isomorphic. I have started with the formal
definition of isomorphism below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

If the graphs have the same number of nodes and each node is connected to every other node then you can make a map that assigns each vertex in graph 1 to the graph2 vertex so they must be one to one connections. Since each node is connected to every other node then each node has the same number of edges. Since they have the same number of nodes all connected to every other node the combinations are the same for both graphs. Thus graph1 and graph2 are isomorphic.
