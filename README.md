# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ have the same number of nodes and are
completely connected, they must be isomorphic. I have started with the formal
definition of isomorphism below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

If the two graphse have the name number of nodes and each node is connected to every other node. then each node would have n-1 edges. Since both games have teh same number of nodes and the same number of edges. If we pair up the nodes one-to-one we can create a mapping where each node in the first graph is matched with a node in the second. Because the graphs are complete any two nodes that you look at are connected to eachother and their matched node would also be connected in the same way so this would also mean that they are isomorphic.
